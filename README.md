# Homework1

-To visualize the robot in rviz2 use the following command:

    $ ros2 launch arm_description display.launch.py

When rviz2 is open, to visualize the robot it’s necessary set the voice “Fixed frame” = “world”, add “RobotModel” and set in it the voice “Description Topic” = “/robot_description”

-To spawn the robot in Gazebo with the use of controllers use the following command:

    $ ros2 launch arm_gazebo arm_gazebo.launch.py

-After spawning the robot in Gazebo, to view the images given by the camera use the following command:

    $ ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

When rqt_image_view is open, to view the image it’s necessary select “/videocamera”

-After spawning the robot in Gazebo, to run the node talk_list:

    $ ros2 run arm_controller talk_list

In another terminal, to publish the joints’ position via command line we use:

    $ ros2 topic pub JointPositionController/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "{data: [0 ,0, 0, 0]}"

(you can change the values in data)

-We have added a record of the robot changing its configuration. To rewatch the record, unzip the "bag_files" folder and write on terminal this command:

    $ ros2 launch arm_gazebo arm_gazebo.launch.py

and on another terminal, we write:

    $ cd src/Homework1/bag_files/rosbag2_2024_10_29-20_18_22

    $ ros2 bag play rosbag2_2024_10_2
